## üîê Data Security Best Practices

### **Development & Testing**
- **Always test with sample data** before adding real member information
- **Use obviously fake examples** (alphabetical patterns work well: Alan Adams, Barbara Baker, etc.)
- **Keep development spreadsheets separate** from production data

### **Production Deployment**
- **Restrict spreadsheet access** to authorized deacons only
- **Use Google Workspace permissions** to control data visibility
- **Regular security review** of who has access to church member data

### **Contributing with Sample Data**
When reporting issues or requesting features:
- **Replace real member data** with sample information
- **Use the established pattern**: Andy A, Barbara Baker, Chloe Cooper
- **Test with fake data** before sharing spreadsheets for troubleshooting

For detailed setup instructions, see [SETUP.md](SETUP.md).

## üéØ The Math Behind It

This system solves a complex mathematical problem in rotation scheduling called "harmonic resonance." When the ratio of deacons to households creates mathematical harmonics (like 12:6 or 14:7), simple rotation algorithms cause deacons to visit only the same household(s) repeatedly.

Our **optimal pattern generator** uses intelligent scoring to:
- Prioritize deacons with fewer total visits
- Favor new deacon-household pairings  
- Prevent same-cycle double assignments
- Maximize variety while maintaining fairness

## üîÑ Development Workflow

### **Working with Enhanced Modules**
```bash
# Development in separate modules
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ module1-core-config.js      (Enhanced with Breeze/Notes)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ module2-algorithm.js        (Unchanged)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ module3-export-utils.js     (Enhanced with URL shortening)

# Deployment (concatenated)
deacon-rotation-combined.js
```

### **Benefits of Modular + Integration Approach**
- ‚úÖ **Easier maintenance** - Church management features isolated in specific modules
- ‚úÖ **Better debugging** - URL shortening and API issues contained
- ‚úÖ **Team collaboration** - Multiple developers can work on integration features
- ‚úÖ **External API management** - Rate limiting and error handling centralized
- ‚úÖ **Future expansion** - Ready for additional church management integrations
