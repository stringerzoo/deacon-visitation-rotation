## üêõ Major Issues Resolved

### Google Calendar API Rate Limiting (v24.1)
**Issue**: Rapid deletion and creation of calendar events triggered Google's API rate limits, causing "too many calendar operations" errors.

**Solution**: Implemented intelligent rate limiting with:
- Batch deletion with pauses every 10 events
- 2-second cooldown between deletion and creation phases
- Batch creation with pauses every 25 events
- Progress logging for transparency
- Individual event error isolation to prevent cascade failures

### URL Shortening Integration (v24.1)
**Issue**: Need for shortened URLs to improve calendar event descriptions and provide easy access to Breeze profiles and visit notes.

**Solution**: Integrated TinyURL's free API with:
- No account requirements for ease of deployment
- Automatic Breeze URL construction from 8-digit numbers
- Fallback to full URLs if shortening fails
- Batch processing with delays to respect API limits
- Storage of shortened URLs in dedicated columns for reuse

### Church Management System Integration (v24.1)
**Issue**: Deacons needed quick access to household information in Breeze CMS and visit documentation in Google Docs during pastoral visits.

**Solution**: Comprehensive integration system with:
- Direct links to Breeze profiles using 8-digit identifiers
- Google Docs integration for visit notes and documentation
- Enhanced calendar events with clickable links
- Automatic URL shortening for cleaner presentation
- Structured event descriptions with clear information hierarchy

### Column Layout Optimization (v24.0)
**Issue**: Previous column layout had deacon reports far from main schedule and configuration scattered across multiple locations.

**Solution**: Comprehensive layout redesign that positioned deacon reports adjacent to main schedule and consolidated configuration settings.

### Harmonic Resonance Problem (v18.0-v23.0)
**Issue**: Mathematical harmonics in deacon/household ratios caused deacons to visit only the same household(s) repeatedly.

**Solution**: Developed optimal pattern generator with intelligent scoring system that guarantees variety while maintaining fairness.
